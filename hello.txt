Hello,

My name is Antonell Michele Rega. I have done a master's degree in actuarial science at the University of Lausanne. During this master, I learned to code on VBA. Now, I'm actually working as an actuary in Lausanne. I began to work in life insurance where I learned to code on Python without dealing a lot of with data (we received data and simulated cashflow throw time). Then, I switch position in non-life insurance where I work with Power BI and Tableau where I learned to explore data. Due to the security system and limitation of licence, I principaly explore data with Excel.
